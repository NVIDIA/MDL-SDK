/// %Handle class template for interfaces, automatizing the lifetime control via reference counting.
///
/// The Handle class is smart-pointer class that handles the reference counting of interface classes
/// automatically. A handle stores internally a pointer to the underlying interface class.
///
/// Template parameter:
///   - \c Interface: an interface class, i.e., either the
///     mi::base::IInterface class itself or a class derived from it.
///
/// \note
/// The Handle class is const correct: Use Handle< const I > for a const pointer to an interface
/// class \c I and Handle< I > for a mutable pointer to an interface class \c I.
///
/// The Handle class has two constructors which differ in the way they handle ownership of the
/// interface pointer they are constructed from (actually, there is a third constructor, the default
/// constructor, which constructs an invalid handle). In the first form mi::base::Handle<I>(I*) the
/// Handle instance takes ownership of the interface. In the second form
/// mi::base::Handle<I>(I*,Dup_interface) it does not take ownership of the interface, but
/// duplicates it.
///
/// The following two examples, based on the neuraylib API, illustrate the use of both constructors.
/// The first example demonstrates the prevailing use case where you want to locally store the
/// interface pointer returned from an API function for subsequent usage. In this case you should
/// use the first form of the constructor which takes ownership of the interface.
///
/// \code
///     mi::base::Handle<mi::neuraylib::INeuray> neuray( mi_neuray_factory());
///     neuray->start( true);
/// \endcode
///
/// On the other hand, assume that you want to store a pointer to an interface whose lifetime you do
/// not control. This typically happens when a pointer is passed as parameter to a function. By
/// convention such pointers are owned by the function caller.
///
/// \code
///     void foo( mi::base::IInterface* interface)
///     {
///         mi::base::Handle<mi::base::IInterface> handle( interface, mi::base::DUP_INTERFACE);
///         // do something with handle
///     }
///
///     mi::base::IInterface* interface = ...
///     foo( interface);
///     // do more things with interface
/// \endcode
///
/// If you had not used the second form of the handle constructor in this example, the handle
/// destructor would have decremented the reference counter of \c interface to 0 at the end of
/// foo(). Therefore, the corresponding interface would have been destroyed and the \c interface
/// pointer would be invalid after the foo() call.
///
/// In contrast, the second form of the handle constructor does not take ownership of the \c
/// interface pointer, but increments the reference count once more. Consequently, when the handle
/// is destroyed, the reference count does not drop to 0.
///
/// Note that this use case often shows up when you store a pointer passed in via a member function
/// as a class member.
