/// This factory function is the only public access point to all algorithms and data structures in
/// the \neurayLibraryName. It returns a pointer to an instance of the main #mi::neuraylib::INeuray
/// interface, which is used to configure, to start up, to operate, and to shut down
/// \neurayProductName. The #mi_neuray_factory_deprecated() function may be called only once.
/// This function is deprecated. Please use #mi_factory() instead.
///
/// \param allocator   The memory allocator to be used. This feature is not yet supported.
/// \param version     The desired version of #mi::neuraylib::INeuray. The parameter is an integer
///                    number that specifies the desired API version, which is set by default to the
///                    current API version given in the symbolic constant #MI_NEURAYLIB_API_VERSION.
///                    This parameter supports the use case where an application uses an older
///                    \neurayApiName version but links with a newer \neurayLibraryName. In this
///                    case, the newer library can still support the older API in a binary
///                    compatible fashion. Only in rare circumstances do you need to set the API
///                    version number explicitly.
/// \return            A pointer to an instance of the main #mi::neuraylib::INeuray interface, or
///                    \c nullptr in case of failures. Possible reasons for failures are
///                    - \p allocator is not \c nullptr,
///                    - the valued passed for \p version is not supported by this library, or
///                    - the function is called a second time.
///                    A typical cause for the second reason is that the library used at runtime
///                    does not match the headers used at compile time.

/// - an instance of the main #mi::neuraylib::INeuray interface, which is used to configure,
/// to start up, to operate and to shut down \neurayProductName. This interface can be requested

/// \return            A pointer to an instance of the requested interface, or \c nullptr if there
///                    is no interface with the requested UUID. This can happen if the library used
///                    at runtime does not match the headers used at compile time. In addition,
///                    \c nullptr is returned if the interface #mi::neuraylib::INeuray is requested
