/// This interface is used for configuring the logging for the \neurayLibraryName.
///
/// The \neurayApiName allows to configure the logging in several ways. You can control the logging
/// by providing an own logger object that implements the #mi::base::ILogger interface. By default,
/// all messages are written to stderr.
///
/// There are two types of loggers, forwarding and receiving loggers. From an application point of
/// view the flow of a log message is as follows: The application sends the message to the
/// forwarding logger which forwards it to the \neurayLibraryName. The message is processed, and if
/// not discarded, sent to the logging host (if distinct from the local host), and passed to the
/// receiving logger. Both types of loggers use the same interface
/// #mi::base::ILogger. The receiving logger can be set by the application, the forwarding logger
/// cannot be controlled and is provided by the \neurayLibraryName.
///
/// The amount of messages can be controlled via log levels. There are two different kinds of log
/// levels, one overall log level, and log levels for individual message categories. These log
/// levels act as independent filters; only messages passing both log level settings are reported.
///
/// Note that setting a particular log level implies all higher log levels, e.g.,
/// #mi::base::details::MESSAGE_SEVERITY_WARNING includes #mi::base::details::MESSAGE_SEVERITY_ERROR
/// and #mi::base::details::MESSAGE_SEVERITY_FATAL.
///
/// In a cluster setup only one host, the logging host, receives the log messages of all hosts. The
/// selection of the logging host is controlled via log priorities (see #set_log_priority()).
/// Forwarding of log messages to the logging host can be disabled (see #set_log_locally()).
