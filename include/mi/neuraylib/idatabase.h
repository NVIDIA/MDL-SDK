\section mi_neuray_database_limitations Database limitations

The database does not support certain usage patterns. These patterns can not be rejected
programmatically, but need to be ensured by the user for proper operation.

\ifnot DICE_API
\note This section mentions some DB internals, e.g. \c tags, which are not further explained here.
\endif


\subsection mi_neuray_database_reuse_of_names Re-use of names of DB elements eligible for GC

The database requires that database elements that are eligible for removal by the garbage collection
must not be accessed under any circumstances. Failure to observe this limitation can have fatal
consequences, i.e., lead to crashes.

\subsubsection mi_neuray_database_invalid_reuse Invalid re-use

When is a DB element eligible for garbage collection? For simplicity, we assume that there is only
a single scope, and no parallel transactions. A DB element becomes eligible for garbage collection
if (a) the DB element has been flagged for removal via \if DICE_API
#mi::neuraylib::IDice_transaction::remove() \else #mi::neuraylib::ITransaction::remove() \endif in
this or a past transaction, and if (b) at the end of a transaction the DB element is no longer
referenced by other DB elements. From this point on, the asynchronous garbage collection may remove
the element at any point in time and the element must not be accessed anymore under any
circumstances.

The limitation "at the end of the transaction" in condition (b) above applies only to state changes
happening in the context of a transaction. This is typically the case for almost all user-initiated
state changes (stores, edits, removal requests, etc.). The most prominent type of state changes not
happening in the context of a transaction are the actions of the garbage collection. For example,
if the garbage collection collects an element A which causes an element B to be no longer referenced
(and B has already been flagged for removal), then element B becomes \em immediately eligible for
garbage collection.

\ifnot DICE_API
Example (invalid re-use of names):
\code
mi::base::Handle<mi::neuraylib::IDatabase> database(
    neuray->get_api_component<mi::neuraylib::IDatabase>());

mi::base::Handle<mi::neuraylib::IScope> scope( database->get_global_scope());

mi::base::Handle<mi::neuraylib::ITransaction> transaction1(
    scope->create_transaction());
{
    mi::base::Handle<mi::neuraylib::ITexture> texture(
        transaction1->create<mi::neuraylib::ITexture>( "Texture"));
    // For simplicity, creation and flagging for removal in the very same transaction.
    transaction1->store( texture.get(), "texture");
    transaction1->remove( "texture");
}
// The DB element "texture" is eligible for garbage collection after this call.
transaction1->commit();

mi::base::Handle<mi::neuraylib::ITransaction> transaction2(
    scope->create_transaction());
{
    // Invalid re-use of the name "texture".
    mi::base::Handle<const mi::neuraylib::ITexture> texture(
        transaction2->access<mi::neuraylib::ITexture>( "texture"));
}
transaction2->commit();
\endcode
\endif

The limitation applies to all kinds of accesses, most prominently, but not limited to, via
\if DICE_API #mi::neuraylib::IDice_transaction::access() and
#mi::neuraylib::IDice_transaction::edit(). \else #mi::neuraylib::ITransaction::access() and
#mi::neuraylib::ITransaction::edit(). \endif Basically, it applies to all methods with names of
database elements as parameters (\em not limited to \if DICE_API #mi::neuraylib::IDice_transaction
\else #mi::neuraylib::ITransaction\endif).

\subsubsection mi_neuray_database_valid_reuse Valid re-use

One notable exception are \if DICE_API the various methods for store operations on
#mi::neuraylib::IDice_transaction. \else #mi::neuraylib::ITransaction::store() and the target name
in #mi::neuraylib::ITransaction::copy().\endif That is, you can safely store new database elements
under names eligible for GC. For such a store \ifnot DICE_API or copy\endif operation, there are two
possible situations:
- The reference count is actually zero and the previous element can be collected by the GC at any
  time. In this case a new tag is assigned, it is not flagged for removal, and, therefore, the
  element is not eligible for GC (as if the name was never in use before).
- The reference count is non-zero. While the old element is not yet eligible for GC, it could become
  so at any time after the GC collected all referencing elements. In this case the same tag is
  reused and it continues to be flagged for removal. However, even if all referencing elements are
  collected by the GC, this element itself is exempted from GC until the end of the transaction.
  This allows to create new references to safely increase the reference count.

\ifnot DICE_API
Example (valid re-use of names):
\code
mi::base::Handle<mi::neuraylib::IDatabase> database(
    neuray->get_api_component<mi::neuraylib::IDatabase>());

mi::base::Handle<mi::neuraylib::IScope> scope( database->get_global_scope());

mi::base::Handle<mi::neuraylib::ITransaction> transaction1(
    scope->create_transaction());
{
    mi::base::Handle<mi::neuraylib::ITexture> texture(
        transaction1->create<mi::neuraylib::ITexture>( "Texture"));
    // For simplicity, creation and flagging for removal in the very same transaction.
    transaction1->store( texture.get(), "texture");
    transaction1->remove( "texture");
}
// The DB element "texture" is eligible for garbage collection after this call.
transaction1->commit();

mi::base::Handle<mi::neuraylib::ITransaction> transaction2(
    scope->create_transaction());
{
    mi::base::Handle<mi::neuraylib::ITexture> texture(
        transaction2->create<mi::neuraylib::ITexture>( "Texture"));
    // Valid re-use of the name "texture".
    transaction2->store( texture.get(), "texture");
    // Valid re-use of the name "texture".
    mi::base::Handle<const mi::neuraylib::ITexture> texture2(
        transaction2->access<mi::neuraylib::ITexture>( "texture"));
    // Adding a reference to "texture" within this transaction will definitely make it no longer
    // eligible for GC (in case it inherited the "flagged for removal" property).
}
transaction2->commit();
\endcode
\endif

\subsubsection mi_neuray_database_strategies Strategies

Complying with the limitation for names eligible for GC can be quite difficult since names might not
be under the user's control, e.g., due to the name occurring in a given \if DICE_API scene. \else
scene, or if names are determined by \neurayProductName itself as for many MDL elements.\endif There
are some strategies that can help avoiding this problem:

<b>Strategy A: Use a different scope for each scene.</b> The recommendation is not to use the
global scope at all, but different child scopes for each scene. The different scope means that
names from other scopes are not visible for the current scope, and, therefore, do not count as
re-use of that name. Besides, using separate scopes has also the benefit that one can easily get
rid of a particular scene without the risk of leaving some remnants behind due to missing removal
flags.

<b>Strategy B: Ensure that the DB element has actually been garbage collected before its name is
re-used. </b> This can be achieved by an enforced, synchronous run of the garbage collection between
the end of the transaction in which the DB becomes eligible for garbage collection and the next use
of that name (see #mi::neuraylib::IDatabase::garbage_collection()). Keep in mind though that other,
parallel transactions might delay the point in time at which a DB element becomes eligible for
garbage collection. While this approach is usually rather simple to implement, it causes a delay due
to ending the current and starting a new transaction, and the synchronous garbage collection run
itself. In addition it might not have to intended effect due to parallel transactions.

<b>Strategy C: Avoid that the DB element becomes eligible for garbage collection.</b> An obvious
approach not to flag DB elements for removal at all is usually not an option. But it is possible to
delay the eligibility for garbage collection to a later point in time when strategy B can be easily
implemented: Create \if DICE_API a database elements \else an attribute container with a
user-defined attribute of type \c "Ref[]" \endif which references all DB elements flagged for
removal. At a favorable time for synchronous garbage collection, flag this \if DICE_API database
element \else attribute container \endif for removal, and use strategy B. Care needs to be taken
that this \if DICE_API database element \else attribute container \endif is not edited from parallel
transactions (see \if DICE_API #mi::neuraylib::IDice_transaction \else #mi::neuraylib::ITransaction
\endif for the semantics of edit operations in parallel transactions). Note that this strategy just
delays the problem, but does not solve it by itself.


\subsection mi_neuray_database_scopes Identical names due to different scopes

See #mi::neuraylib::IScope for general documentation about scopes.

Be careful when \em storing DB elements of the same name in different scopes. If the scopes are not
in a parent-child relation, then the following limitation does not apply since no transaction will
ever see both elements. But if the scopes are in a parent-child relation, then it is required that
the store operation happens first in the parent scope and that this element is visible in the child
scope before the store operation in that child scope occurs (in the same transaction, or with
different transactions where the first one is committed before the second one is started).
Otherwise, this results in different DB elements of the same name (and not just different versions
of the same DB elements as it would happen when the correct order is observed).

\ifnot DICE_API
Example (creation in wrong order):
\code
mi::base::Handle<mi::neuraylib::IDatabase> database(
    neuray->get_api_component<mi::neuraylib::IDatabase>());

mi::base::Handle<mi::neuraylib::IScope> parent_scope( database->get_global_scope());

mi::base::Handle<mi::neuraylib::IScope> child_scope(
    database->create_scope( parent_scope.get()));

// DB element with name "texture" is created first in the child scope ...
mi::base::Handle<mi::neuraylib::ITransaction> child_transaction(
    child_scope->create_transaction());
{
    mi::base::Handle<mi::neuraylib::ITexture> texture(
        child_transaction->create<mi::neuraylib::ITexture>( "Texture"));
    child_transaction->store( texture.get(), "texture");
}
child_transaction->commit();

mi::base::Handle<mi::neuraylib::ITransaction> parent_transaction(
    parent_scope->create_transaction());
{
    mi::base::Handle<mi::neuraylib::ITexture> texture(
        parent_transaction->create<mi::neuraylib::ITexture>( "Texture"));
    // ... and is not visible here.
    parent_transaction->store( texture.get(), "texture");
}
parent_transaction->commit();

// The name "texture" maps now to two different tags. Both tags are visible from the child scope via
// tag references (not part of this example), but only one of them via name.
\endcode
\endif

While such a situation is not necessarily a problem for the database itself, it leads to unexpected
behavior on the user side, as accesses might return different instances, depending on the details
of the access method.

This limitation does not apply if there is already a DB element with name accessible at the time of
the store operation, i.e., the method does not create a new DB element, but essentially
overwrites/edits an existing one.


\subsection mi_neuray_database_transactions Identical names due to parallel transactions

See \if DICE_API #mi::neuraylib::IDice_transaction \else #mi::neuraylib::ITransaction \endif for
general documentation about transactions.

The database does not support the \em storing of DB elements in parallel transactions, unless these
DB elements have different names or the scopes are different and are not in a parent-child
relation to each other. Failure to observe this limitation results in different DB elements of the
same name (and not just different versions of the same DB elements as it would happen with
serialized transactions).

\ifnot DICE_API
Example (wrong creation in parallel transactions):
\code
mi::base::Handle<mi::neuraylib::IDatabase> database(
     neuray->get_api_component<mi::neuraylib::IDatabase>());

mi::base::Handle<mi::neuraylib::IScope> scope( database->get_global_scope());

mi::base::Handle<mi::neuraylib::ITransaction> transaction1(
    scope->create_transaction());
mi::base::Handle<mi::neuraylib::ITransaction> transaction2(
    scope->create_transaction());

{
    mi::base::Handle<mi::neuraylib::ITexture> texture(
        transaction1->create<mi::neuraylib::ITexture>( "Texture"));
    transaction1->store( texture.get(), "texture");
}

{
    mi::base::Handle<mi::neuraylib::ITexture> texture(
        transaction2->create<mi::neuraylib::ITexture>( "Texture"));
    transaction2->store( texture.get(), "texture");
}

transaction1->commit();
transaction2->commit();

// The name "texture" maps now to two different tags. Both tags are visible via tag references from
// the global scope (not part of this example), but only one of them via name. \endcode
\endif

While such a situation is not necessarily a problem for the database itself, it leads to unexpected
behavior on the user side, as accesses might return different instances, depending on the details
of the access method.

This limitation does not apply if there is already a DB element with name accessible at the time of
the store operations, i.e., the method does not create new DB elements, but essentially
overwrites/edits an existing one.

Note that \em editing (as opposed to storing) the very same DB element in parallel transactions is
supported by the database, but it is discouraged, since the semantics might not be as desired (see
\if DICE_API #mi::neuraylib::IDice_transaction \else #mi::neuraylib::ITransaction \endif).


\subsection mi_neuray_database_references References to elements in more private scopes

See #mi::neuraylib::IScope for general documentation about scopes.

Be careful when creating references to DB elements that exist in a different scope than the
referencing element. References to elements in parent scopes (or the the same scope) are perfectly
fine. But you must not create references to DB elements that exist only in a more private scope.
Typically, this happens when using \if DICE_API #mi::neuraylib::IDice_transaction::store() \else
#mi::neuraylib::ITransaction::store() \endif with an (explicit) wrong privacy level.

\ifnot DICE_API
Example (invalid reference to element in more private scope):
\code
mi::base::Handle<mi::neuraylib::IDatabase> database(
    neuray->get_api_component<mi::neuraylib::IDatabase>());

mi::base::Handle<mi::neuraylib::IScope> parent_scope( database->get_global_scope());

mi::base::Handle<mi::neuraylib::IScope> child_scope(
    database->create_scope( parent_scope.get()));

mi::base::Handle<mi::neuraylib::ITransaction> child_transaction(
    child_scope->create_transaction());
{
    mi::base::Handle<mi::neuraylib::IImage> image(
        child_transaction->create<mi::neuraylib::IImage>( "Image"));
    check_success( 0 == child_transaction->store( image.get(), "image"));
    mi::base::Handle<mi::neuraylib::ITexture> texture(
        child_transaction->create<mi::neuraylib::ITexture>( "Texture"));
    check_success( 0 == texture->set_image( "image"));
    // Triggers an error message since "texture" is to be stored in the parent scope (due to
    // explicit privacy level 0), but references "image" in the child scope.
    check_success( 0 == child_transaction->store( texture.get(), "texture", 0));
}
child_transaction->commit();

mi::base::Handle<mi::neuraylib::ITransaction> parent_transaction(
    parent_scope->create_transaction());
{
    mi::base::Handle<const mi::neuraylib::ITexture> texture(
        parent_transaction->access<mi::neuraylib::ITexture>( "texture"));
    // Triggers a fatal message about an invalid tag access.
    const char name = texture->get_image();
}
parent_transaction->commit();
\endcode
\endif

A reference to an element in a more private scope triggers an error message when the referencing
element is stored in the DB, but does not prevent the operation from being completed nor is it
signaled via a return code. As soon as the incorrect reference is used, this triggers a fatal error
message (and the process aborts if it returns from the logger callback). Even if the incorrect
reference is never used, its existence hints at a conceptual error in the way the application uses
scopes.
