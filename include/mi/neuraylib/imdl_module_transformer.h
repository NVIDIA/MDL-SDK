/// \note Beware of the following implicit changes to MDL modules when using the module transformer,
///       in particular from the point of view of MDL source code:
///       - All comments are removed.
///       - Defaults are inserted for parameters without arguments.
///       - Conversion between named and positional arguments.
///       - Reformatting of the MDL source code.
///       - Possibly restructuring of alias declarations (including introduction of new ones).
