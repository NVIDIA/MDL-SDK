/// This interface represents a pixel image file. It supports different pixel types, 2D and 3D image
/// data, and mipmap levels. Its main usage is in textures, see the #mi::neuraylib::ITexture class.
///
/// The image coordinate system has its origin in the lower left corner in the case of 2D image
/// data.
///
/// \par Editing and copying an image
///
/// Note that editing an existing image has unusual semantics that differ from all other DB
/// elements. Usually, when editing a database element, an identical copy of the database element is
/// created (the existing one cannot be used because it might be needed for other transactions,
/// other scopes, or in case the transaction is aborted). For images, this implies a copy of all the
/// pixel data which is very expensive.
///
/// There are only two mutable methods on this interface, #reset_file() and #set_from_canvas();
/// all other methods are const. Both methods eventually replace the entire pixel data anyway.
/// Therefore, when an image is edited, the pixel data is not copied, but replaced by a dummy image
/// of size 1x1. This approach saves the unneeded, but expensive copy of the original pixel data.
/// When afterwards one of two methods above is called, the image uses the correct pixel data
/// again.
///
/// Note that this also affects the results from methods like #resolution_x(), etc. (if you want
/// to know the resolution of an existing image without changing it, you should access the image,
/// not edit it). Furthermore, you might end up with the dummy image if you do not call
/// #reset_file() or #set_from_canvas() (or if these methods fail).
///
/// Note that using the transaction's copy function has the same semantics when used on an image.
/// Thus after copying it is necessary to use either #reset_file() or #set_from_canvas() on the
/// copy.
