/// Propagation types for attribute inheritance.
///
/// Inheritance of attributes allows you to easily make changes to an entire subtree of the scene
/// graph. \if IRAY_API For example, by setting the \c visible attribute of an
/// #mi::neuraylib::IGroup element to \c false, the entire subtree will become invisible (unless one
/// of its elements has a \c visible attribute, too, and its value is \c true). Similarly, materials
/// can be inherited down the scene graph to elements that do not have their own material.\endif
///
///
/// Assume the scene graph contains an inner node P (the parent) \if IRAY_API like
/// #mi::neuraylib::IGroup or #mi::neuraylib::IInstance \endif with a (possibly inherited)
/// attribute A and a child node C. If the child node C does not have the attribute A, the child
/// will inherit P's value of A (without actually storing an explicit copy). If the child node C has
/// the attribute A, it will use its own value of the attribute without taking P's value into
/// consideration. This is the standard propagation rule which is represented by the propagation
/// type #mi::neuraylib::PROPAGATION_STANDARD.
///
/// The outcome of the last case can be reverted by setting the \c override flag of the attribute A
/// on the parent node (or at the node from where it was inherited to P): in this case P's value of
/// A is inherited to the child node C, no matter whether the child has the attribute or not. This
/// propagation mode is represented by #mi::neuraylib::PROPAGATION_OVERRIDE.
///
/// \note There is one exception to these rules: If the child node C is a geometry object, then P's
///       value of A is used, no matter whether the propagation mode was set to
///       #mi::neuraylib::PROPAGATION_OVERRIDE or #mi::neuraylib::PROPAGATION_STANDARD. The
///       rationale is that for geometry objects the attribute on the object itself should be a
///       default that is only used if no value for that attribute is inherited.
///
/// \note Inherited attributes are made available to the render modes, but are not available via the
///       \neurayApiName.

/// Attributes can be inherited in the scene graph. For details, see
/// #mi::neuraylib::Propagation_type.
///
/// \note Setting an attribute value is done by value (or deep copy) and not by reference. This

/// reference.

/// \if IRAY_API
///
/// \see
/// The #mi::neuraylib::IOptions class has many attributes controlling global settings.
///
/// \par Attributes
/// - bool \b disable \n
///   If set to \c true, the element is ignored. If the element references sub-elements in the scene
///   graph, like instances or groups do, these references will be ignored as well. (Of course,
///   there may be other references of non-disabled elements that can make shared sub-elements in
///   their context visible.) This attribute is not supported for decals. \n
///   \n
///   This attribute, once set to \c true, cannot be reset to \c false by elements lower in the
///   scene graph. This can be used to efficiently turn off objects, lights and groups by disabling
///   their referencing instance element; it would be much more expensive to detach or attach them
///   to the scene graph because that requires preprocessing the scene again.
/// - bool \b visible \n
///   The object or light is visible to primary rays. This attribute is not supported for decals or
///   volumes.
/// - bool \b picking_disabled \n
///   The object, light, or volume is invisible to pick rays. This attribute does not have an effect
///   on generated images and merely affects the behavior of mi::neuraylib::IRender_context::pick().
/// - bool \b matte \n
///   The object or light is treated as a matte object.
/// - #mi::Float32 \b matte_shadow_intensity \n
///   Scaling factor to tune the artificial shadow cast on matte objects. The default is 1.0.
/// - bool \b matte_connect_to_environment \n
///   Only effective if the backplate function or backplate color is set. Matte
///   objects will then use the environment instead of the backplate for secondary interactions.
/// - bool \b matte_connect_from_camera \n
///   Only effective if no backplate function and no backplate color is set, or if
///   a backplate function or backplate color is set and in addition the
///   matte_connect_to_environment flag. Matte objects will then use a local lookup into the real
///   world photograph instead of a global one.
/// - bool \b backplate_mesh \n
///   Only effective if the backplate function or backplate color is set. The object is then
///   treated as a 3D-environment/backplate.
/// - #mi::IRef \b backplate_mesh_function \n
///   Reference to a texturing function (#mi::neuraylib::IFunction_call) that may be used to
///   override the main camera backplate for a backplate mesh
/// - bool \b movable \n
///   The object may be subject to frequent transformation changes. Render modes might take that
///   hint into account and use special data structures to speed up such transformation changes.
///   This also controls instancing in user mode. See the [:ipmlink rendering instancing-general]
///   section for details.
/// - bool \b reflection_cast \n
///   The object is visible as a reflection in reflective objects.
/// - bool \b reflection_recv \n
///   The object is reflective.
/// - bool \b refraction_cast \n
///   The object is visible through refractive objects.
/// - bool \b refraction_recv \n
///   The object is refractive.
/// - bool \b shadow_cast \n
///   The object casts shadows.
/// - bool \b shadow_recv \n
///   The object can have shadows cast onto it.
/// - #mi::Sint32 \b label \n
///   An object ID that is useful in conjunction with render target canvases of type
///   #mi::neuraylib::TYPE_OBJECT_ID.
///   See #mi::neuraylib::IRender_target_base for details.
/// - #mi::Sint32 \b material_id \n
///   A material ID that is useful in conjunction with render target canvases of type
///   #mi::neuraylib::TYPE_MATERIAL_ID.
///   See #mi::neuraylib::IRender_target_base for details.
/// - const char* \b handle \n
///   An object or light ID that is useful in conjunction with Light Path Expressions.
///   See Section [:ipmlink reference Light path expressions] of the Iray Programmer's Manual
///   for details.
/// - bool \b shadow_terminator_offset \n
///   Controls the automatic shadow terminator handling.
///   See the [:ipmlink physically_plausible_scene_setup Tessellating curved surfaces] section for

/// #mi::neuraylib::IDecal, and via inheritance for instances of #mi::neuraylib::IGroup and
/// #mi::neuraylib::IInstance.
/// - #mi::IRef \b material or #mi::IArray \b material \n
///   A reference to a material instance, or an array of such references.
/// \par
/// For decals, the array is limited to length 1.
/// \par
/// The following attribute is only meaningful for instances of #mi::neuraylib::ILight, and via
/// inheritance for instances of #mi::neuraylib::IGroup and #mi::neuraylib::IInstance.
/// - bool \b important \n

/// The following attribute is only meaningful for instances of #mi::neuraylib::ITriangle_mesh,
/// #mi::neuraylib::IPolygon_mesh, #mi::neuraylib::ISubdivision_surface, and
/// #mi::neuraylib::IFreeform_surface, and via inheritance
/// for instances of #mi::neuraylib::IGroup and #mi::neuraylib::IInstance.
/// - struct Approx \b approx \n
///   This attribute controls the refinement of triangle and polygon meshes with displacement, and
///   the subdivision level of subdivision surfaces and freeform surfaces. The attribute is a struct
///   and has the members described below. A corresponding structure declaration is registered under
///   the type name \c Approx.
///   - #mi::Float32 \b const_u \n
///     Stores the constant \c c or \c c_u for parametric or distance ratio approximation, or the
///     length bound for length or UV length approximation.
///   - #mi::Float32 \b const_v \n
///     Stores the constant \c c_v for parametric approximation.
///   - #mi::Sint8 \b method \n
///     Five methods are available, parametric approximation (0), length approximation (1), UV
///     length approximation (2), distance ratio approximation (3), and adaptive displacement
///     approximation (4).
///     \n
///     Parametric approximation is available for triangle and polygon meshes with displacement,
///     subdivision and freeform surfaces. For the first three object types it subdivides each
///     primitive (triangle or quadrangle) into 4^\c c primitives for some parameter \c c (polygons
///     are tessellated first). For freeform surfaces, assume that each surface patch has degrees \c
///     deg_u and \c deg_v. Each surface patch is subdivided into \c deg_u * \c c_u times \c deg_v *
///     \c c_v triangle pairs.
///     \n
///     Length approximation is available for triangle and polygon meshes with displacement, and for
///     freeform surfaces, but not for subdivision surfaces. It subdivides the primitives until all
///     edges have a length (in object space) below a specified bound.
///     \n
///     UV length approximation is available for triangle and polygon meshes with displacement.
///     It subdivides the primitives until all edges have a length (in UV space) below a specified
///     bound.
///     \n
///     Distance ratio approximation is available only for freeform surfaces. The parameter \c c
///     is an upper bound for the ratio of the distance of the approximation to the original
///     curve/surface and the length of the corresponding edge in the approximation. For example,
///     a value of 0.01 means that the error is at most 1/100 of the edge length in the
///     approximation. Typical values of the approximation constant for the distance ratio method
///     are in the range [0.01,0.1].
///     \n
///     Adaptive displacement approximation is applicable on triangle and polygon meshes with
///     displacement, subdivision and freeform surfaces and comprises two passes.
///     The first pass is driven by the \c base_method
///     parameter and specifies the initial subdivision. The second pass then adaptively
///     refines the initial subdivision based on displacement values and is driven by the
///     \c quality parameter. For subdivision and freeform surfaces the \c base_method defines
///     the surface triangulation.
///     Note that adaptive tessellation is currently not supported for meshes with more than one
///     material region.
///     \n
///     The length bound as well as the parameter \c c are stored in the field \c const_u. The
///     The parameters \c c_u and \c c_v are stored in the fields \c const_u and \c const_v,
///     respectively.
///     \n
///   - #mi::Sint8 \b base_method \n
///     Specifies the initial approximation for the adaptive displacement approximation. Supported
///     methods for triangle and polygon meshes are parametric (0), length (1) and UV length (2).
///     For subdivision surfaces only parametric (0) is supported, for freeform surfaces one can
///     use parametric (0), length (1) and distance ratio (3).
///     For the controls, see \c method.
///   - #mi::Float32 \b quality \n
///     Specifies the quality of the second pass of the adaptive displacement approximation. With
///     higher quality, more displacement samples are taken and potentially more triangles are
///     created. The default range is from zero (no additional triangles in second pass) to one
///     (up to 32 subdivisions). Higher values are possible and may create more subdivisions.
/// \par
/// The following attributes are only meaningful for instances of #mi::neuraylib::ITriangle_mesh,
/// and #mi::neuraylib::IPolygon_mesh, and via inheritance
/// for instances of #mi::neuraylib::IGroup and #mi::neuraylib::IInstance.
///   - #mi::Sint32 \b approx_triangle_limit \n
///     Specifies an upper bound for the number of triangles generated by a displacement
///     approximation. By default, the limit is set to 10M triangles.
///   - #mi::Float32 \b approx_geometry_from_shading_normals  \n
///     Specifies a factor by which vertices are offset according to their corresponding shading
///     normal in order to make the tessellated mesh more smooth. Valid
///     values are in the range [0.0,1.0]. By default the value is zero which means no offset.
///   - #mi::Sint32 \b enable_tessellation_of_undisplaced_meshes \n
///     If enabled, tessellation is being performed also in the case that there is no
///     displacement function defined for the given mesh, which can be useful sometimes
///     for meshes with a low triangle count, especially in conjunction with the
///     attribute \c approx_geometry_from_shading_normals.
/// \par
/// The following attribute is only meaningful for instances of #mi::neuraylib::IFreeform_surface,
/// and via inheritance for instances of #mi::neuraylib::IGroup and #mi::neuraylib::IInstance.
/// - struct Approx \b approx_curve \n
///   This attribute controls the subdivision level of curve segments of freeform surfaces. The
///   attribute is a struct and has the same structure as the "approx" attribute (see above). Note
///   that there is only one attribute for all curve segments together.
/// \par
/// The following attributes are only meaningful for instances of #mi::neuraylib::ITriangle_mesh,
/// #mi::neuraylib::IPolygon_mesh, #mi::neuraylib::ISubdivision_surface,
/// #mi::neuraylib::IFreeform_surface, #mi::neuraylib::IOn_demand_mesh,
/// and via inheritance for instances of #mi::neuraylib::IGroup and #mi::neuraylib::IInstance.
/// - bool \b crackfree_displacement \n
///   When enabled, vertices with matching positions are displaced to the same target position
///   (by averaging their displacement values and normals) in order to prevent cracks.
///   By default, this option is disabled.
/// - #mi::Float32 \b crackfree_displacement_point_tolerance \n
///   Controls epsilon by which points are considered equal when detecting duplicates for
///   crackfree displacement. The default value of 1e-5 should be sufficient in most cases.
///   Note that too large values might cause undesired results.
/// - #mi::IArray \b decals \n
///   An array of references (#mi::IRef) that attaches the given decals or instances of decals
///   to the scene element. This is similar to the \c material attribute, however, note that
///   in contrast to the \c material attribute the scene element with the \c decals attribute
///   influences the world-to-object transformation of the decal. This attribute is inherited as
///   usual with the exception that when a parent node P and a child node C both have the \c decals
///   attribute the rules detailed in #mi::neuraylib::Propagation_type do not apply. Instead, the
///   array elements of the \c decals attribute in P are appended to the array elements from C.
/// - #mi::IArray \b enabled_decals \n
///   An array of references (#mi::IRef) that acts as filter to determine the active decals.
///   Only decals in that array can be active. Defaults to the (inherited) value of the \c decals
///   attribute.
/// - #mi::IArray \b disabled_decals \n
///   An array of references (#mi::IRef) that acts as filter to determine the active decals.
///   Decals in that array are never active. Defaults to the empty array.
/// \par
/// The list of active decals at a geometry node is given by the intersection of \c decals and
/// \c enabled_decals minus \c disabled_decals (taking attribute inheritance into account).
/// \par
/// The element order in the \c decals attribute is used to break ties between decals of equal
/// priority: if decal D1 is in front of decal D2 and both have equal priorities, decal D1 will
/// appear on top of decal D2 (assuming both are overlapping, otherwise it is not relevant anyway).
/// \par
/// The following attributes are only meaningful for instances of #mi::neuraylib::ITriangle_mesh,
/// #mi::neuraylib::IPolygon_mesh, #mi::neuraylib::ISubdivision_surface,
/// #mi::neuraylib::IFreeform_surface, #mi::neuraylib::IOn_demand_mesh,
/// and via inheritance for instances of #mi::neuraylib::IGroup and #mi::neuraylib::IInstance.
/// - #mi::IArray \b projectors \n
///   An array of references (#mi::IRef) that attaches the given projectors or instances of
///   projectors to the scene element. This is similar to the \c material attribute, however, note
///   that in contrast to the \c material attribute the scene element with the \c projectors
///   attribute influences the world-to-object transformation of the projector. This attribute is
///   inherited as usual with the exception that the propagation type
///   #mi::neuraylib::PROPAGATION_OVERRIDE is not supported.
/// - #mi::IRef \b active_projector or #mi::IArray \b active_projector \n
///   Specifies the active projector(s). If more than one projector is given, the renderer may
///   choose one projector per uv-space (up to four) from this list.
///   The attribute defaults to the (inherited) elements of the \c projector
///   attribute. It allows to specify projectors different from the inherited default,
///   or to disable the inherited default. Only projectors that appear in \c projectors attributes
///   on the path from this node to the root are feasible.
///
/// \see
/// The free functions #mi::set_value() and #mi::get_value() including the various specializations
/// may help to write/read values to/from attributes. Note that there are variants operating on
/// \link mi_neuray_scene_element attributes sets \endlink as well as directly on instances of
/// \link mi_neuray_types mi::IData \endlink.
///
/// \par Example
/// The following code snippet is an example that shows how to copy all attributes from one
/// attribute set to a different one. Three boolean flags allow to customize its behavior. Note
/// that the function stops as soon as the assignment fails for one attribute (which might
/// happen if \c adjust_attribute_types is \c false and the types are incompatible).
