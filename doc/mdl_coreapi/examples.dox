/*! \page mi_mdl_core_examples Tutorial and Example Programs

We provide examples for the use of the \MDLCoreApiName
that illustrate -- in a tutorial manner -- the important
interfaces and concepts.

\if MDL_SOURCE_RELEASE
\section mi_mdl_core_examples_build Building the Examples

Please refer to the file Readme.md in the toplevel directory of the MDL SDK Source Repository for 
instructions on how to build \MDLCoreProductName and the examples.
