/*! \page mi_neuray_getting_started Getting Started

\NeurayProductName is a software component that you can embed in your application
to provide MDL support in your application.

The \neurayApiName is a C++ API. \NeurayProductName is provided as a dynamic library, which can be
linked to your application or dynamically loaded at runtime.

\section mi_neuray_getting_started_overview Overview

The \neurayAdjectiveName release contains the following parts:

  - A platform-dependent shared library (a.k.a. DLL) named \e libmdl_sdk.
  - A set of platform-independent C++ include files,
    see the \ref mi_neuray_includes section for all available module specific include
    files.
  - A collection of example programs; see the \ref mi_neuray_examples section.
  - A programmers manual (this document).
  - Installation instructions.

\section mi_neuray_getting_started_recom Recommendation

It is recommended that you read the brief \ref mi_neuray_design
section and continue with the \ref mi_neuray_examples section. The
\ref mi_neuray_intro_config section describes how to configure aspects
of the library to your particular integration demands.

\section mi_neuray_getting_started_compile Building the examples

The \neurayAdjectiveName release contains a set of example programs. It is
recommended that you compile them and take them as a starting point
for your own development.

\if MDL_SOURCE_RELEASE

Please refer to the file INSTALL.md in the toplevel directory of the \neurayAdjectiveName Source Repository for
instructions on how to build the \neurayAdjectiveName and the examples.
\else

The \neurayAdjectiveName uses [CMake](http://www.cmake.org/) to generate build files for the examples.
It is required to use CMake 3.12 or later (3.21 or later on Windows),
which can be downloaded from the [CMake Website](https://cmake.org/download/).
When using a Unix-like system, you can install the *cmake* package using 
the respective package management systems.

\subsection mi_neuray_getting_started_dependencies Dependencies

The example source code requires a C++17 compiler. Some examples require additional third-party libraries.

The build with the following 64-bit platform-compiler combinations has been 
successfully tested:

-   **Windows 10:**            Microsoft Visual Studio 2022 (msvc v143)
-   **CentOS 7, Debian 13:**   GCC 12 (on x86-64 or aarch64)
-   **Mac OS X 12.6:**         Xcode 14.2 (Apple Clang 14.0.0, on x86-64 or aarch64)

The versions listed with the following dependencies have been
successfully tested. Where not mentioned otherwise, other versions
might work as well.

The following third-party dependencies are used by several and/or major
examples. Installation is strongly recommended unless the corresponding group
of examples is of no interest to you.

-   <a name="vcpkg">**vcpkg**</a> *(git commit ID ef7dbf9)*
    [Vcpkg](https://vcpkg.io/en/getting-started.html) is the recommended way to
    install other dependencies like GLEW and GLFW. The
    vcpkg version mentioned above corresponds to the versions mentioned for
    these dependencies below. \n
    Windows: It is strongly recommended to select the same toolset that is used
    later to build the examples, e.g., by adding
    *set(VCPKG_PLATFORM_TOOLSET v143)* (or similar) to
    *triplets/x64-windows-static.cmake*. See the corresponding section in the
    [vcpkg documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/vcpkg/users/triplets#windows-specific-variables)
    for further details. Add the vcpkg option *--triplet=x64-windows-static* to
    the *install* command. There is no need to run the *integrate* command.

-   **DirectX Raytracing support** (Windows only) \n
    Building the DXR example requires Windows 10 version 1909 and the
    corresponding SDK 10.0.22621.0. Additionally the optional *Graphic Tools*
    feature has to be installed.

-   **DirectX Shader Compiler support** (July 2022) (Windows only) \n
    Building the DXR example requires an updated version of the DirectX Shader
    Compiler. \n
    Download and extract the pre-compiled x64 binaries from
    [github](https://github.com/microsoft/DirectXShaderCompiler/releases).

-   **GLEW** *(2.2.0)* \n
    This dependency is required for all OpenGL-based examples. \n
    Installation via [vcpkg](#vcpkg) is strongly recommended. Install the vcpkg
    package *glew*.

-   **GLFW** *(3.4)* \n
    This dependency is required for all OpenGL- and Vulkan-based examples. \n
    Installation via [vcpkg](#vcpkg) is strongly recommended. Install the vcpkg
    package *glfw3*.

    Building the Vulkan examples requires the Vulkan headers and validation layers,
    volk, and glslang. \n
    Installation via [vcpkg](#vcpkg) is strongly recommended. Install the vcpkg
    packages *glslang*, *volk*, and *vulkan-validationlayers*.

The following third-party dependencies are only used by fewer or single
examples, or add additional features to other examples. Installation can be
safely skipped unless you are specifically interested in those examples or
features.

-   **Clang** *(12.0.1)* \n
    This dependency is required to build the OptiX 7 example. \n

\subsection mi_neuray_getting_started_windows_build Building on Windows

1.  Before generating the Visual Studio solution, be sure to
    download and extract or install the third-party libraries listed
    above.  The following steps assume you have extracted the pre-compiled 
    binaries to a common third-party directory that is:

        C:/projects/thirdparty

2.  Open CMake-Gui, click `Browse Source...` and select the example directory of the extracted mdl-sdk. 
    This directory contains the top-level *CMakeLists.txt*.  Pick a build directory that will 
    contain the files for your build system and eventually, the compiled 
    example binaries.

    It is recommended that you build into a subdirectory, not into the example root.
    C:/projects/mdl-sdk/examples/build/vs2022 for example is fine, assuming you extracted the mdl-sdk to:

        C:/projects/mdl-sdk

3.  After clicking ``Configure``, CMake asks you to choose the
    Generator. Select `Visual Studio 17 2022` (or higher) and click
    `Finish`. CMake starts to configure the build and stops several
    times when user input is required to resolve dependencies.

4.  Optionally, you can select or deselect 
    Additional CMake Options (see below) by checking and 
    un-checking the boxes next to the entries that start with *MDL*. Click
    ``Configure`` again to continue.

5.  When red error messages appear in the log, identify the dependency path 
    that is requested and resolve the error by specifying the corresponding 
    entry in CMake-Gui. Then, click ``Configure`` again to continue. Repeat 
    this step until no further errors occur.

    During this process, you may need to setup the following entries based on the selected components:

    -   **ARNOLD_SDK_DIR** in Ungrouped Entries, \n
        for example: *C:/projects/thirdparty/Arnold-6.2.0.1-windows*

    -   **clang_PATH** in Ungrouped Entries (only if not found in the PATH), \n
        for example: *C:/Program Files/LLVM-12/bin/clang.exe*

    -   **CUDA8_PATH** in Ungrouped Entries, \n
        for example: *C:/Program Files/NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit/CUDA/v8.0* \n
        Version 8 is mandatory here, used for the OptiX 7 example.

    -   **DXC_DIR** in Ungrouped Entries, \n
        for example: *C:/projects/thirdparty/dxc_2022_07_18*

    -   **MATERIALX_DIR** in Ungrouped Entries, \n
        for example: *C:/projects/thirdparty/git/MaterialX* \n
        See also the option
        [MDL_MSVC_DYNAMIC_RUNTIME_DXR_EXAMPLE](#mdl-msvc-dynamic-dxr).

    -   **python_PATH** in Ungrouped Entries (only if not found in the PATH), \n
        for example: *C:/projects/thirdparty/python_3_10_0/bin/python.exe*

    -   **Qt5_DIR** in Ungrouped Entries (only if not installed using the installer) \n
        for example: *C:/Qt/5.10.1/msvc2017_64*

    -   **PANTORA_AXF_DIR** in Ungrouped Entries \n
        for example: *C:/projects/thirdparty/pantora-axf-1.9.0*

    Note: when you installed a new Visual Studio version after installing CUDA,
    you may have to reinstall CUDA to register it correctly with Visual Studio.
    Otherwise, CMake won't find the CUDA compiler.

6.  When all dependencies have been resolved or the corresponding examples 
    have been disabled as indicated in the CMake error messages, the log 
    will show that the configuration is done.

    Generate the Visual Studio solution by clicking ``Generate`` and open it 
    afterwards using ``Open Project``. CMake-Gui is not needed anymore and
    can be closed.

    You can also open the Visual Studio solution directly from the build 
    directory.

7.  Use Visual Studio to build the examples. 
    When running the examples using the Visual Studio debugger, 
    you can provide additional command line arguments by specifying them in the 
    individual Visual Studio project settings. To run the examples by double-clicking the
    executable in the build directories or by using the command line you need to add
    the location of the *libmdl_sdk.dll* or the plugins to your environment PATH
    or copy them into the corresponding example folder.
    
\subsection mi_neuray_getting_started_linux_build Building on Linux

1.  Before generating make files, you need to install the required
    tools and libraries as listed \link mi_neuray_getting_started_dependencies above\endlink.

2.  Before running CMake, create a build directory that will contain 
    your make files and switch to that directory. It is recommended 
    that you build into a subdirectory, not the example root folder: 

        mkdir $HOME/mdl-sdk/examples/build
        cd $HOME/mdl-sdk/examples/build

3.  To generate your build files, run CMake with the path to the top-level 
    *CMakeLists.txt* as the last argument.

    1.  When all dependencies are installed correctly, the default settings 
        should complete the configuration without any further interactions necessary.
        In this case, you can continue with step 4.

            cmake ../..

    2.  Optionally, you can use CMake options and the *-D* flags to customize your build.

        One or multiple of these flags can be used to enable and disable examples, for example:

            cmake -DMDL_ENABLE_QT_EXAMPLES=OFF ../..

        You can also use the flags to point CMake to custom installation
        directories for third party libraries. Please refer to
        \link mi_neuray_getting_started_windows_build Windows build\endlink
        for a list of supported flags. For the vcpkg installation, the call to
        CMake could look as follows:

            cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=$HOME/projects/thirdparty/vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake ../..

        For builds using a different compiler version, you need to pass the 
        compiler names when calling CMake as follows:

            sudo apt-get install gcc-11 g++-11
            cmake -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=/usr/bin/gcc-11 -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=/usr/bin/g++-11 ../..

    3.  In case CMake is not able to find a working CUDA compiler for the 
        examples, make sure the *nvcc* is reachable through the system PATH 
        variable before running CMake:

            export PATH=<CUDA_SDK_DIR>/bin:$PATH

    4.  If Qt5 cannot be found, or you want to use an extracted package 
        rather than installing Qt on your system, you can optionally set 
        an additional environment variable before calling CMake:

            export Qt5_DIR=$HOME/Qt/5.10.1/gcc_64

        or pass the Qt5_DIR as CMake option:

            cmake -DQt5_DIR=$HOME/Qt/5.10.1/gcc_64 ../..

4.  After a successful configuration, you can run make from within the
    specified build directory or any subdirectory that corresponds to a
    source directory containing a *CMakeLists.txt*:

        make

5.  Because the different MDL SDK libraries are loaded at runtime, the 
    location has to be provided in order to run an example. Therefore, 
    specify the paths to the built MDL SDK library and 
    the image plugins using the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` variable (on x86-64):

        export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$HOME/mdl-sdk/linux-x86-64/lib:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}

    or (on aarch64):

        export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$HOME/mdl-sdk/linux-aarch64/lib:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}

    To run the MDL SDK Modules example for instance use:

        cd $HOME/mdl-sdk/examples/build/examples/mdl_sdk/modules/Debug
        ./modules
  
\subsection mi_neuray_getting_started_macosx_build Building on Mac OS X

1.  Before generating make files, you need to install the required
    tools and libraries as listed \link mi_neuray_getting_started_dependencies above\endlink.

2.  Depending on your workflow, you can use CMake-Gui and follow the \link mi_neuray_getting_started_windows_build Windows instructions\endlink 
    or use the command line as described in the \link mi_neuray_getting_started_linux_build Linux section\endlink.
    In each case, begin with step 2 of the respective instructions.

    If the brew packages, CUDA, and Qt have been installed correctly,
    the following CMake option needs to be specified:

    -   **Qt5_DIR** in Ungrouped Entries,  
        for example: *$HOME/Qt/5.10.1/clang_64*

3.  After successfully configuring and generating make files, switch to the selected build directory and run make:

        make

4.  Because the different MDL SDK libraries are loaded at runtime, the 
    location has to be provided in order to run an example. Therefore, 
    specify the paths to the built MDL SDK library and 
    the image plugins using the `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH` variable:

        export Qt5_DIR=$HOME/Qt/5.10.1/clang_64
        export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=$HOME/mdl-sdk/macosx-x86-64/lib:${Qt5_DIR}/lib:${Qt5_DIR}/plugins/imageformats:${DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH}
        
    To run the MDL SDK Modules example for instance use:

        cd $HOME/mdl-sdk/examples/build/examples/mdl_sdk/modules/Debug
        ./modules

\subsection mi_neuray_getting_started_cmake_options Additional CMake Options

The following options enable you to select the components to be built:

-   **MDL_BUILD_SDK_EXAMPLES** \n
    [ON/OFF] enable/disable the MDL SDK examples (see also below for ways to
    enable/disable examples based on their required thirdparty dependencies).

-   **MDL_ENABLE_PYTHON_BINDINGS** \n
    [ON/OFF] enable/disable the generation and compilation of the MDL Python Bindings.

\subsection mi_neuray_getting_started_custom_build Custom build environments

You can integrate \neurayProductName easily in other build
environments. You can also compile the examples by hand following the
steps below. Let the environment variable \c \$MDL_SDK_ROOT refer to
the installation root of \neurayProductName.

  -# Use the \neurayAdjectiveName include files in your source:
     \code
#include <mi/mdl_sdk.h>
     \endcode
     Load the \neurayLibraryName dynamically and access the API entry point:
     \code
mi::neuraylib::INeuray* neuray = load_and_get_ineuray();
     \endcode
     See \c examples/example_shared.h for the definition of this convenience method.
     Alternatively, if you want to use the #mi::base::Handle class:
     \code
mi::base::Handle<mi::neuraylib::INeuray> neuray( load_and_get_ineuray());
     \endcode
     For a start, you can copy the examples that come with the \neurayAdjectiveName release, make
     them writable, and change into that directory:
     \code
cp -r $MDL_SDK_ROOT/examples .
chmod -R u+w examples
cd examples
     \endcode
     <br>
  -# Compile the program with the appropriate include path switch that
     points the compiler to the location of the \neurayAdjectiveName include
     files. A \c g++ compiler call could look like this:
     \code
g++ -I$MDL_SDK_ROOT/include -c example_start_shutdown.cpp -o example_start_shutdown.o -pthread
     \endcode
     <br>
  -# Link the program with the library that provides \c dlopen().
      A \c g++ linker call could look like this:
     \code
g++ -o example_start_shutdown example_start_shutdown.o -ldl -pthread
     \endcode
     <br>
  -# Make the shared library (a.k.a. DLL) known to your runtime system so that it is found when
     starting the example program. You can do this by placing the shared library in an appropriate
     location, and/or setting environment variables such as \c PATH (on Windows), \c LD_LIBRARY_PATH
     (on Linux), or DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH and DYLD_FRAMEWORK_PATH (on MacOS X).
     Note: This step is platform and installation dependent.
