## What is MDL?


### Material definition language 

NVIDIA Material Definition Language (MDL) is a domain-specific programming
language that you use to define physically-based materials and lights for
rendering. It is designed for the definition of the highest quality materials,
fast rendering, and serves as an industry standard for material exchange.

### MDL materials 

Materials consist of two parts -- A *material definition* and *functions*:

* The *material definition* is declarative and based on a robust material model.
    
    **Example:** The following code snippet is a simple declarative material
    definition.  In the example, the material `generic_diffuse_material` defines
    a single material parameter  `diffuse_color`.  This parameter is used to
    define the color for the diffuse reflection BSDF `diffuse_reflection_bsdf`.

        export material diffuse( color diffuse_color = color(0.7))
            = material(
                surface: material_surface (
                    scattering: df::diffuse_reflection_bsdf (
                        tint: diffuse_color
                    )
                )
            );

* *The functions*, which are written in a procedural programming language,
  compute parameter values for the material model.
    
    **Example:** In the following code snippet, the `tiles` function computes
    the color for a tile at a particular texture coordinate to define a
    checkerboard. The parameters define the number of tiles in one direction
    and the two colors for the black and white tiles. The computation uses
    math functions from the MDL standard math library.

        export color tiles( int no_tiles,
                            color black = color(0.1),
                            color white = color(0.8))
        {
            float3 uvw = step(0.5, frac( no_tiles/2 * state::texture_coordinate(0)));
            float black_or_white = frac((uvw.x + uvw.y)*0.5)*2.0;
            return lerp( black, white, black_or_white);
        }

    The following code snippet uses the `tiles` function to define a
    checkerboard material with eight times eight tiles per uv unit square.

        export material checker() = diffuse( tiles( 8));

    Refer to [Material Definition Language Handbook](http://mdlhandbook.com/) for
    more details on the MDL language.

## What is the MDL SDK?

The following sections describe the purpose of the MDL SDK, an example
workflow supported by the SDK, and a link to the installation instructions.


### Purpose

The MDL SDK is a toolkit delivered as an open source C++ library. It is
designed to support a wide range of material workflows in new or existing
applications.


### Example usage

The following figure illustrates an example workflow for material creation:

![*Figure 2. Example of a material workflow supported by the MDL SDK*](doc/images/mdl_sdk_workflow.png)

The callouts in the figure are described below. Each callout describes
how a specific SDK component supports this material workflow:

1.   **MDL modules:**
You use the module mechanism to package materials and functions for re-use.
An MDL module contains one or more material and function definitions. When
you load a module it is parsed and validated by the MDL compiler and its
content is stored in an internal database.

2.   **Internal database:**
The internal database provides access to all material and function definitions. 

3.   **Transactions and call graphs:**
You create, edit, and store material instances and function calls using
transactions. The results are stored in the internal database. From
database entities, you can connect functions to material parameters and
build call graphs that express complex materials.

4.   **Compiled materials:**
You can compile these graphs into a compact optimized representation, which
is referred to as a *compiled material*. The compilation step includes
inlining of call expressions, constant folding and the elimination of
common subexpressions.

5.   **Distilling and texture baking:**
Distilling is a process for mapping or simplifying compiled MDL materials
to more limited material models used by specific renderers.

6.   **Texture baking:**
Baking textures ensures optimal rendering performance for game engines.

7.   **Backends:**
A compiled material is the basis for code generation.
The SDK provides the following backends for code generation:

     * CUDA PTX
     * LLVM 12 IR 
     * HLSL and GLSL
     * Native code generation for the CPU

The SDK also provides:

*   **Example programs:**
To help you get started using the MDL SDK, working example programs are
provided. See ["Getting started using the SDK"](#getting-started-using-the-sdk)
for an introduction to these example programs.

*   **Documentation:**
A detailed MDL specification, as well as conceptual, user, and reference
API documentation is included with the MDL SDK. You can also access this
documentation set from the
[NVIDIA Ray Tracing Documentation](https://raytracing-docs.nvidia.com/mdl/index.html)
website.


### Installing the SDK
