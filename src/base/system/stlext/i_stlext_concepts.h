/// \brief Useful base classes to express common C++ concepts.
///
///    - Non_copyable          Derive from this class to make an object non-copyable.
///
///    - Abstract_interface    Derive from this class to make sure your
///                            interface classes have a virtual destructor.
///
///    - Derived_from<T, B>    Ensure that type T is derived from B.
///
///    The class "noncopyable" is a useful little helper class which defines a
///    private copy constructor and assignment operator. Thus, derived classes
///    cannot be copied.
///
///    The class "Abstract_interface" is supposed to be a common base class
///    for abstract interfaces; especially classes with pure virtual
///    functions.
