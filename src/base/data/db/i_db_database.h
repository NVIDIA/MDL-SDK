/// to denote the convention for each pointer in parameters and return values.
///
/// - RCS:NEU reference count unchanged/neutral, for parameters and return values
/// - RCS:ICE reference count incremented by callee, for return values
/// - RCS:ICR reference count incremented by caller, for parameters, rare, e.g.,
///           Transaction::finish_edit()
/// - RCS:TRO transfers ownership, for parameters and return values, rare, e.g.,
///           Transaction::store(), Transaction::construct_empty_element(),
///           Element_base::copy() and Element::copy(), Job_base::copy(), and Job::copy().
